This is version 3.0.0-unofficial.7 by MouseyPounds

The BFAV code is based on the Github "bfav-3.0.0" branch <https://github.com/paritee/Paritee.StardewValley.Frameworks/tree/bfav-3.0.0>, with the following changes:
- Updated Nuget packages for mod build config to 3.0.0 and Newtonsoft JSON to 12.0.3
- Added a static ModEntry instance to ModEntry in order to access Helper from other classes, spacechase-style (sorry Pathos)

- Changed all the PariteeCore.Utilities.Mod.Path references to instead use ModEntry.Instance.Helper.DirectoryPath to work around GetExecutingAssembly().Location failing on Mac & Linux
- Changed the Harmony patching from an attribute-based PatchAll to individual API Patch calls for compatibility with Mac & Linux
- Changed some of the error-message handling related to invalid items, suppressing errors related to meat values unless Animal Husbandry is installed and implementing the SaveNotLoaded exception
- Added some extra checks to the AnimalHouse.resetSharedState patch to avoid "egg-hatching" messages when any animal building was entered
- Changed some of the FarmAnimal.DayUpdate() logic to avoid having double-products and leftover "produce ready" as well as send "laid" items to auto-grabbers.
- Adjust width of PurchaseAnimalsMenu to accomodate the 5-icon rows (see below)

The rest of the mods in the Framework solution have not been touched and were just ignored when building; they are not included in this source package.

The Paritee Core code is based on the Github master branch <https://github.com/paritee/Paritee.StardewValley.Core/tree/master> with the following changes:
- Changed a dailyLuck call to Game1.player.dailyLuck for 1.4 compatibility
- Changed a sound cue reference to use ICue
- Changed the method which populates the animal shop menu to use rows of 5 icons instead of 3.

Note that the BFAV source was actually built against the Paritee Core 2.0.1 Nuget package, and the Core DLL was then replaced with the updated version afterwards.
