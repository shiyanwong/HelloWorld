If you want the wall in the lower greenhouse section to look like the one in my screenshots take the town interior png and replace the one in A Toned Down Stardew Valley (you will need to do this for any updates to that mod as well so save a copy somewhere). And set the config on ATDSV to use the warm appearace. 

If you don't want the dark trim/normal greenhouse walls go ahead and delete the town interior_warm png from this mod. 

*note* you can also rename the png to town interior_standard and replace that version if you'd rather have the standard version of A Toned Down Stardew Valley.
