<< MOD COMPATIBILITY >>
!! PLEASE NOTE: In order for mod compatability to function properly, as these CP mods simply replace images,
if there's more than one sprite being patched, the one that ends up showing up is the latest one. What that
means is that this mod must be the LOWEST folder in the list among all your other CP mods for it to properly
work and not get overwritten by another mod.

• Currently Incompatible (visually, not functionally) with Iridium Recolors by 6480

• Blue Iridium: This mod works with the Blue Iridium mod, BUT, the one I found only had xml files and was not
compatable with CP so I converted it myself, for myself. If you have found a distributed CP converted version
that is commonly used by others please let me know about it, or tell me the UniqueID found in the manifest.json
and I will update to include it.
• Coordinated Crafting Bars: This mod works with the Coordinated Crafting Bars mod by Yifal.
• Glass Milk Bottles: This mod works with the Glass Milk Bottles mod by andiluxe.
