What does this mod include?

This mod adds Steve from Stranger Things into your game! He is a marriable NPC with a custom spouse room and festival locations.
Steve comes with 4 new heart events (2,4,6 and 8) but not the 10 heart event (which will be made custom in future).

Errors:

-Steve will show up for festivals but when the main festival events happen, he disappears. 
For example, at the flower festival, he will be standing there, but when the dance happens Steve suddenly disappears.

Compatability?

Steve is not compatible with other npc mods (But does work with Stardew Valley Expanded!).
For example, if you downloaded another npc mod it wouldn't show up in game because the files have already been edited by Steve's NPC.


Things that will be updated in future?

-Tweaks to Steve's portrait
-Custom 10 heart event
-Tweaks to Steve's schedule - will spend more time in the mines
-Animations! Which I can't get to work at the moment but will at some point! 


This mod was made possible by Miss Coriel's Content Patcher Template for custom NPC's! 

Thank you so much for downloading this mod - I really hope you enjoy having Steve in your world!
