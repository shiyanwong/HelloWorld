The most common error is not installing the correct version of  "Content Patcher Animations"

The correct version "1.4" is on the Developer Site linked in "Requirements" And not in the Nexus.




Flickering animations may be caused by another mod editing the same tile space.

For example : 
The prismatic Test animation on CP-animations
And this mod Prismatic Shard

you fix it by removing/disabling one
